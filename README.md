##Resources Used
* **Codecademy:** I used this source primarily as a refresher on Javascript syntax. It help primarily with the second function we had to create in regard to using if/else statements.
* **Introduction to Javascript course on Lynda.com:** I've been using this resource for a while. It also helped me get more comfortable with Javascript syntax, particularly with functions. 

##Comments
I had a pretty easy time with this assignment with the exception of the final function ( inception(callback,value )). I struggled through this for a few days without being able to figure out the solution. I spent days trying to make return work within my second function (movie), but randomly tried console.log instead and it worked.

I reinstalled the plugins that you mentioned in the last bit of feedback. I've been using tab to nest everything, but I'm not sure if that's what you require. Please let me know if I'm doing it wrong.

Thanks for your feedback and efforts!
